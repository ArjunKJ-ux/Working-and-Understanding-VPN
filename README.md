## What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is like a secure tunnel for your internet connection. It hides your real location (IP address) and scrambles your online data (encrypts it). This makes it harder for anyone to see what you're doing online, keeping you safer and more private.

## VPN I Used

For this project, I used **ProtonVPN**.

* **Why ProtonVPN?** I chose ProtonVPN because it offers a reliable free service that focuses on privacy and security.

## How I Connected

Here are the simple steps I followed to use ProtonVPN:

1.  **Signed Up and Downloaded:**
    * I went to the ProtonVPN website.
    * I signed up for a free account.
    * I downloaded and installed their app on my computer.

2.  **Opened and Connected:**
    * I opened the ProtonVPN app.
    * I logged in.
    * I picked a server location, which was in the **Netherlands**.
    * I clicked the "Connect" button.

3.  **Checked Connection:**
    * The app showed that I was successfully connected to the VPN.

## My IP Address Change

I checked my IP address before and after connecting to see how the VPN changed it.

### Before VPN:
My original IP address and location (from `whatismyipaddress.com`):

* **IP Address:** `103.189.143.180`
* **Location:** Perumpavur, Kerala, India

### After VPN:
My new IP address and location after connecting to ProtonVPN:

* **IP Address:** `185.107.56.135`
* **Location:** Sluiskil, Zeeland, Netherlands

As you can see, my IP address and location changed from India to the Netherlands, proving the VPN worked to hide my real location.

## Internet Speed Change

I also checked my internet speed (using `fast.com`) before and after using the VPN to see if it made a difference.

### Before VPN:
My internet speed was about **40 Mbps**.

### After VPN:
My internet speed was about **24 Mbps**.

![Screenshot of internet speed after VPN connection](Screenshot_2025-06-09_102736.png)
My speed went down from 40 Mbps to 24 Mbps after connecting to the VPN. This is normal because the VPN has to encrypt data and send it through another server.

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about online security.

### Privacy and Encryption
I learned that VPNs are great for privacy. They encrypt (scramble) your data so others can't read it, especially on public Wi-Fi. Hiding your IP address means websites see the VPN's IP, not yours, making it harder to track you.

### Speed Differences
I saw that while VPNs make you safer, they can make your internet a bit slower. This happens because of the extra work (encryption) and the longer path your data has to travel to the VPN server.

## Good Things About VPNs

* **Hides Your IP:** Keeps your real location private.
* **Encrypts Your Data:** Protects your information from being seen by others.
* **Access Restricted Content:** You can access websites or services that might be blocked in your country.
* **Safer on Public Wi-Fi:** Protects you when using insecure public networks.

## Things VPNs Can't Do (Limitations)

* **Might Slow Down Speed:** As I saw, speeds can drop (from 40 Mbps to 24 Mbps).
* **Not 100% Anonymous:** While they boost privacy, smart tracking methods or your own actions can still reveal you.
* **Some Cost Money:** Good VPNs often have a subscription fee (though free options exist like ProtonVPN's free tier).
* **You Trust the Provider:** You need to trust your VPN company with your data.
* **Illegal in Some Places:** VPNs are against the law in a few countries.

## Conclusion

Using a VPN helped me understand its important role in online security. It's a powerful tool for keeping your information safe and private. Even with some speed loss, the benefits of privacy and security are huge for most people. This project was a great hands-on way to learn about network security.
